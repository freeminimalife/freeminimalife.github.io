<div align="justify">
<p>A few weeks ago I read this quote somewhere on Instagram, and I just couldn’t get it out of my head.</p>
<p>So I started repeating to myself,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“If I’m tired, I should learn how to rest, not to quit”.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suddenly something clicked! How many times have I been running away from something just because I got so exhausted of it that I simply didn’t want it anymore. One, two, 20 times maybe? Each time I tried something new, after the thrill of the novelty, suddenly there was not enough time for that, other priorities came and all those (initially exciting) things were left behind.</p>
<p>We get tired, that’s normal in life. We get tired from school, work, relationships, projects, hobbies &amp; places. We get tired and we renounce. Also, we often forget to prioritize, and forget some little aspects and needs of our life: Our health and our time. We start a new job, a new course, a new fitness plan, and we put so much effort into it that we end up hating it. Why do we get to this point? Isn’t it better (to try) to be always in sync with our body and feelings?</p>
<p>But… Hey! The idea here is not to stop doing things, or not working towards our goals anymore! Is the actual opposite!</p>
<p>To keep our energy levels high enough to actually achieve our goals we must <em>plan</em>, and do it properly. In the end, if we made it to the goal, but we’re sick, stressed, isolated or depressed, then I believe we failed…</p>
<p>In my life I’ve been in this situation so many times. At times I decided to quit, another times to continue, even if that meant stopping for a while and getting to the end a bit later. I’m the kind of person who would <em>love</em> to do a bunch of stuff, but it’s hard for me to decide which are the most valuable to me. All seems amazing, then succeeding in all of them becomes problematic, so I end up tired and incapable of giving a 100% in any single task.</p>
<p>That’s enough about me, now I’d like you to just take a couple of minutes to think about how you feel. Are you maybe working too much and missing good quality time with your beloved ones? Not sleeping enough? Overexercising? Over/under eating? Taking care of others and forgetting about yourself? Just <em>stop</em>, and dedicate some minutes (or days/weeks/months) for you, to get a bit retrospective and allow yourself to just feel. It might sound awkward, though. It could feel even painful to acknowledge the situation and accept your current situation in life. It’s not late. Take things slowly, you will get there, but remember to enjoy the path, because that’s were life lives in, not in the final target. So stop, rest, understand your feelings, make some fixes, iterate, keep pushing but don’t overwhelm yourself. Don’t quit yet.</p>
<h3 id="The-bottom-line"><a href="#The-bottom-line" class="headerlink" title="The bottom line"></a>The bottom line</h3><p>Try repeating to yourself again and again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“If I’m tired, I will rest, I will recover, then I can continue. But I will not quit, not this time!”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But not just repeat, implement it as well, give yourself a rest, and keep going, you’ll make it :) Just do the following, quite a simple formula actually…</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Rest -&gt; Recover -&gt; Plan -&gt; Continue -&gt; (Maybe rest again) -&gt; Succeed!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s all for today’s post, my friends. I hope this can help anyone out there who feels almost about to crash or that is just tired or even drained.</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments if you’ve ever experienced this kind of situation. How did you manage to rest and keep going afterwards? I Would <em>love</em> to hear from you :)</p>

                Hello! I’m Karen, nice to meet you :) I'm a computer engineer originally from Venezuela, currently living in Munich. I came to Germany almost a year ago, and after thinking and rethinking, I decided to create freeminimalife to share with you a bit of myself: My thoughts on minimalism, healthy lifestyle, and some delicious recipes I enjoy to prepare.
