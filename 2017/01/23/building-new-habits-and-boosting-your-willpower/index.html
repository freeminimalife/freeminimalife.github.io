<p>When I decided to start this year <a href="http://freeminimalife.com/2017/01/16/sugar-free-challenge-week-2/">without sugar</a>, my main goal wasn’t merely just the fact of renouncing the <em>sweetness</em> in the world forever and then becoming an obsessive person whose <em>one and only</em> purpose in life is eating perfectly clean and sugarfree. Even though I’m avoiding sugar, I wanted to do things right and listen to my body, eating when I felt hungry and avoid restricting myself! The goal was -and still is- to pursue a healthier and more organized life where it’s easier to start adopting better habits and avoiding self-destructive patterns.</p>
<p>So, to start week 3 with some extra motivation I would like to focus on the importance of strengthening our willpower muscle and understand it’s relation on constructing better habits in many different areas of our lives!</p>
<p>I remember back in school and university, that when I had more activities in my life, besides just studying, I used to be more productive in all of them at the same time. Even though I had less free time, I felt healthier and happier than those other times where I just had fewer classes and more free time in general, I simply had extra time to procrastinate and doing everything slower.</p>
<p>Having a tight schedule, mixing many different routines such as physical activity, working, studying, cooking, writing, learning a new language or instrument, etc. might be overwhelming when you are used to doing mostly one thing right. But when you decide to start adding more good challenges to your life, you start working on your self-discipline day after day, therefore, your willpower will get stronger, transforming you into a more productive individual, making you less prone to wasting time and ending up in addictive or self-destructive behaviors.</p>
<p>Imagine taking an extra class every day after work to learn a skill that will add value to your life or to waking up early in the morning to do a workout. Putting this extra effort daily in your life will slowly get you to be more organized. You learn how to cope up with the new difficulties, you change the way you think.</p>
<p>In my case, what made this concept more tangible, was starting to attend German classes four days a week after a long 8-hour day at work. Even though the first weeks I felt like I couldn’t handle it and was incredibly tired, this extra work I put on myself to improve my German skills -which I still have to work on, a lot!-, made me automatically more organized, cooking for the whole week in advance and cutting on extra expenses in order to pay my course without getting out of my budget.</p>
<p>Now, the thing is, you have to continue with this routine for a while, to keep strengthening the willpower muscle! You don’t want to lose those gains you worked so hard to achieve! Remember that if you suddenly stop and don’t get back on track quickly, the willpower will fade away, just as your muscles will start to shrink if you stop going to the gym for a month or two. Starting from scratch is always harder!</p>
<p>With this, I just want to remind you that we can <em>always</em> improve ourselves, but it takes time and effort on our side. It’s best to start adding new routines <em>slowly</em>, as you don’t want to injure your own sanity.Be constant and your willpower will keep growing making you able to do things that currently may seem impossible. So keep going!</p>
<h5 id="Now-some-food-related-updates"><a href="#Now-some-food-related-updates" class="headerlink" title="Now some food related updates:"></a>Now some food related updates:</h5><p>Now, getting back to give a little update on my Sugarfree challenge, it is going great, now I feel like avoiding sugar it’s finally becoming a habit!</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything tastes sweeter now! Natural peanut butter tastes incredibly sweet!</li>
<li>I eat until I feel satiated and then I forget about food.</li>
<li>I don’t have cravings, I can detect when I have real hunger.</li>
<li>I lost interest in desserts, even when they are in front of me and smell nicely.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next weeks are going to get crazy as I will move to a new place, and with that, a lot of chaos comes, but I’ll try to keep posting my updates here and on Instagram as soon as I have some internet connection!</p>
<p>Let me know how your challenge is going so far! You can follow my previous updates  <a href="http://freeminimalife.com/2017/01/09/removing-the-bad-habit-of-sugar-consumption/">here</a> and <a href="http://freeminimalife.com/2017/01/16/sugar-free-challenge-week-2/">here</a>.

                Hello! I’m Karen, nice to meet you :) I'm a computer engineer originally from Venezuela, currently living in Munich. I came to Germany almost a year ago, and after thinking and rethinking, I decided to create freeminimalife to share with you a bit of myself: My thoughts on minimalism, healthy lifestyle, and some delicious recipes I enjoy to prepare.
