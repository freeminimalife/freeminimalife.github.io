<h3 id="Living-with-less-10-steps-to-a-Minimalist-life"><a href="#Living-with-less-10-steps-to-a-Minimalist-life" class="headerlink" title="Living with less: 10 steps to a Minimalist life"></a>Living with less: 10 steps to a Minimalist life</h3><p>Through all my life I always enjoyed having just the amount of things I think needed, it always made feel free. Everytime I saw my room with many more things than the minimum, I started to freak out, grabbed everything that lacked a place in my life, put them in bags and boxes, and give them away. My room always looked empty, but that gave me some sort of inner peace.</p>
<p><em>The less you possess, the freer you are.</em></p>
<p>It’s natural that from time to time you might get attached in a personal level with an object, we’re not perfect, not robots. Our childhood memories, things that remind us to people that are no longer with us, expensive stuff that we don’t really like but they cost a lot at a certain moment (or to a certain person that gave it to us), a piece of clothing you really used to like. It is perfectly fine to keep a few things with you if they can really improve your life and make you feel better, but this shouldn’t be the rule, otherwise, there won’t be even space for yourself.</p>
<p>Life goes on, stuff gets old, and people come and go. You’re not defined by that, but by the experiences you’ve lived and the things you’ve learned until the day you die. There’s not a best or worst way of living, we’re all learning, but I truly believe that simplifying your life and stop giving so much value to inanimate objects do lightens up our journeys.</p>
<p>Coming from a country where life gets more and more difficult day by day, where surviving was my main concern and making sure there will be enough food for dinner, gave me a couple of lessons the hard way. Now that I live in Germany, I appreciate what I have in a different way, I don’t expect that my happiness will come by the things I own, they doesn’t seem to add any special value to my life.<br>It feels good to let things go, no matter where you live, if you focus your energy in what really matters, you’ll eventually find yourself with more time to enjoy life. That’s why I decided to share with you 10 steps I believe that work wonders when trying to just simplify your life:</p>
<h4 id="1-Clean-and-empty-one-shelf-at-home"><a href="#1-Clean-and-empty-one-shelf-at-home" class="headerlink" title="1. Clean and empty one shelf at home"></a>1. Clean and empty one shelf at home</h4><p>Start today, tomorrow, or whenever you feel like you want to make the first big step. Look around and identify the places where most of the clutter is located. Maybe you have a closet that is a monster and you don’t feel prepared to go through all that stuff, so take a smaller one. Small steps won’t overwhelm you that much.</p>
<h4 id="2-Take-many-pictures"><a href="#2-Take-many-pictures" class="headerlink" title="2. Take many pictures"></a>2. Take many pictures</h4><p>If you visit a new place try to take pictures of the beautiful things you see around, capture the beautiful moments with your family, the people, the landscapes. Years after you can find yourself going through the pictures and relive those beautiful memories.</p>
<h4 id="3-Buy-good-quality-items"><a href="#3-Buy-good-quality-items" class="headerlink" title="3. Buy good quality items"></a>3. Buy good quality items</h4><p>Instead of having massive amounts of clothing, accessories,devices, and countless banalities. Try to invest in one high quality item that will last for years, and make you save money and wasted time on going shopping.</p>
<h4 id="4-Avoid-duplicates"><a href="#4-Avoid-duplicates" class="headerlink" title="4. Avoid duplicates"></a>4. Avoid duplicates</h4><p>Rather than having many versions of the same item, just go for having one. The object has a specific purpose in your life, therefore, the necessity will be covered and there’s no need for a second one. Think about hair combs, how many of them do you own? Do you really need more than one hair comb to brush your hair? Are they really so important? Seriously?</p>
<h4 id="5-Go-digital"><a href="#5-Go-digital" class="headerlink" title="5. Go digital"></a>5. Go digital</h4><p>Try to manage everything from your computer and mobile. That is finances, bills, todo lists, calendars, books… Recycle all that paper that is left, you don’t need it anymore.</p>
<h4 id="6-Stay-away-from-trends"><a href="#6-Stay-away-from-trends" class="headerlink" title="6. Stay away from trends"></a>6. Stay away from trends</h4><p>When buying clothes, accessories, furniture… Always go for the most classic designs. They will look good and classy for many years to come. They won’t bother your sight. They will function as they are supposed to.</p>
<h4 id="7-Replace-something-every-time-you-buy-something-new"><a href="#7-Replace-something-every-time-you-buy-something-new" class="headerlink" title="7. Replace something every time you buy something new"></a>7. Replace something every time you buy something new</h4><p>When you’re going shopping, first of all think in what are your real needs and make sure to meet them first. If you need a new sweater for the cold winter, buy one that you really like but when you arrive home, take an old sweater you are not using anymore and give it away to a person in need. This trick really works. I started applying it to my life when I came to Germany. I currently don’t have much space to store things. Everything needs to fit in a pair of suitcases, so It keeps me from buying new stuff. If you’re not prepared to give something you already have at home then it’s better to skip shopping, is not really that important :)</p>
<h4 id="8-Keep-less-needed-stuff-in-a-box-for-some-months"><a href="#8-Keep-less-needed-stuff-in-a-box-for-some-months" class="headerlink" title="8. Keep less needed stuff in a box for some months"></a>8. Keep less needed stuff in a box for some months</h4><p>I know, it is hard at times. There are some things you know you don’t need them but they are nice, they are valuable, you’re attached to them. Then don’t give them away… yet! Just put them in a box. You can keep this box in a closet, garage, keller. You know the stuff is not gone forever but is out of sight. When you’re prepared, then go ahead and donate or sell it.</p>
<h4 id="9-Enjoy-the-time-you-spend-with-your-beloved-ones"><a href="#9-Enjoy-the-time-you-spend-with-your-beloved-ones" class="headerlink" title="9. Enjoy the time you spend with your beloved ones"></a>9. Enjoy the time you spend with your beloved ones</h4><p>And that’s the most important part. Make sure to enjoy what really matters. Stop focusing on the stuff and pay more attention to the little things. Go and spend some quality time with the people you love, while you still can! Life shouldn’t be focused on things. Enjoy a nice meal with your family. We never know what could happen tomorrow.</p>
<h4 id="10-Move-to-a-new-place"><a href="#10-Move-to-a-new-place" class="headerlink" title="10. Move to a new place"></a>10. Move to a new place</h4><p>If  you happen to be moving to a new place or if you’re thinking on making this huge decision, be more conscious than ever. You’re basically starting from scratch, so make sure to keep with you only the most important. It’s the perfect time to make some cleaning in your life!</p>
<p>I’m sure there are many other steps I’m missing, but those are the ones I apply to my life everyday. If you want to dig deeper into the minimalism lifestyle I would suggest you to go and check out these two blogs which have been really inspiring to me in the last couple of years: <a href="https://zenhabits.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">Zen Habits</a> and <a href="http://www.theminimalists.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">The minimalists</a>.</p>
<p>Have you ever managed to live a simpler life? Or to enjoy those little things that surrounds us? I would be more than happy to read your thoughts on this topic, we’re all here to make ourselves better and there’s definitely a place for improvement!</p>

                Hello! I’m Karen, nice to meet you :) I'm a computer engineer originally from Venezuela, currently living in Munich. I came to Germany almost a year ago, and after thinking and rethinking, I decided to create freeminimalife to share with you a bit of myself: My thoughts on minimalism, healthy lifestyle, and some delicious recipes I enjoy to prepare.
